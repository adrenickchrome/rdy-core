**Your intent, ready for anyone who needs it.** rdy stores what you intend and decided, and gives it to whoever needs it in a form they can use: a docs site for people, briefings and instructions for agents. Before an agent writes, rdy shows it what governs the change and what depends on it. After the write, rdy shows what the change affected. Nothing joins the accepted design until a person approves it.

This release adds repo links, and keeps the compatibility promise of Release 1. See "About Release 1" below.

## What you get

- **Docs and decisions as one project.** Write docs, requirements, terms and decisions as linked blocks, not loose files.
- **Agents work through MCP.** Claude Code, or any MCP client, reads and writes through rdy's tools. Each agent gets a briefing before it edits.
- **Instructions for agents.** rdy's own agent guide is built in. Keep your rules in rdy too, each with its reason. Every agent gets the rules it needs at the start of a task, and your own rules follow you to every project.
- **Proposals and approvals.** Agent work lands in a view. You see the impact, then approve it or not.
- **Docs that match the release.** Record which release ships each decision. A public site then shows only what has shipped, and a release check catches content that is ahead of the build.
- **It catches drift.** When a decision changes, rdy marks every page that rests on it. It also flags a page that states a different number for a recorded value.
- **Linked projects.** Cite the decisions and instructions that another project delivers through rdyhub. Your project keeps the version it cites until a person adopts a newer one.
- **A live docs site.** `rdy site` gives you a local site that refreshes as changes land.
- **Local and private.** Everything runs on your machine: no account, no hosted service, no model inside rdy.

## Install

**macOS (Apple silicon) and Linux (x86_64):**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://getrdy.dev/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows 11 (x64), in PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://getrdy.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

Each installer checks the release signature and the archive's SHA-256 before it installs. It puts `rdy` in `~/.local/bin` for your user, and asks before it changes your PATH.

To install from the archive instead:

**macOS (Apple silicon):**

```sh
curl -LO https://github.com/adrenickchrome/rdy-core/releases/download/v0.48.0/rdy-0.48.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar -xzf rdy-0.48.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv rdy-0.48.0-aarch64-apple-darwin/rdy ~/.local/bin/
```

**Linux (x86_64):**

```sh
curl -LO https://github.com/adrenickchrome/rdy-core/releases/download/v0.48.0/rdy-0.48.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xzf rdy-0.48.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv rdy-0.48.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/rdy ~/.local/bin/
```

**Windows (x86_64), in PowerShell:**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile rdy-0.48.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz https://github.com/adrenickchrome/rdy-core/releases/download/v0.48.0/rdy-0.48.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz
tar.exe -xzf rdy-0.48.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.local\bin" | Out-Null
Move-Item -Force rdy-0.48.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\rdy.exe "$HOME\.local\bin\"
```

On macOS and Linux, if `~/.local/bin` is not on your PATH, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your shell profile. On Windows, add `$HOME\.local\bin` to your PATH. Then check:

```sh
rdy --version
```

It prints `rdy 0.48.0`.

On macOS, if you downloaded the archive in a browser instead of with curl, macOS may block the binary. Run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/bin/rdy` once.

## Release key

This release is signed by rdy's machine release key, the same key that signed 0.46.0 and 0.47.0. To check the signature of your download, follow "Verify the download" in the README. The allowed-signers line for v0.48.0:

```text
rdy-release namespaces="rdy-release-v1" ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIUyk+U70yjuD/Ixg86ti9BBo0Kc/NL0ps3KAOAIVC/8
```

Fingerprint: `SHA256:Tj8hfra0U07asaeSZkt1b5e1HGJ+w8vMzLrn+G6/+/M`.

Compare this line and fingerprint with the ones in the README at v0.48.0. Use the key only when both match.

## Try it: your first project

1. **Make a project.**

   ```sh
   rdy init ~/my-project && cd ~/my-project
   ```

2. **Connect your agent.** For Claude Code:

   ```sh
   claude mcp add rdy -- rdy mcp --project "$PWD"
   ```

   For another MCP client, add this server to its config (write the full path; most clients do not expand `~`):

   ```json
   { "mcpServers": { "rdy": { "command": "rdy", "args": ["mcp", "--project", "/home/you/my-project"] } } }
   ```

   On Windows, give the native path, such as `C:\Users\ana\my-project`, and write each backslash twice in JSON.

   A session lasts as long as one `rdy mcp` process, and keeps one actor and one run. To start another run, start a new `rdy mcp` process. A client that starts a new process for each call must start a new session each time.

   The agent claims its own `agent:` actor, such as `agent:claude`, when it starts a session. rdy's guide tells it to. Approving stays with you: an agent cannot start an approver session over MCP.

3. **Set up rdy for your agents.**

   ```sh
   rdy setup
   ```

   It creates your own rules project, the meta project, if you have none. It also adds three lines at the top of `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` that tell the agent to call `rdy_session`, then `rdy_instructions`, at the start of each task. That call gives the agent rdy's guide, so you download nothing.

4. **Ask your agent for something real.** For example:

   > Start an rdy session in your own view, then read its overview. Help me design retention for an AI support assistant. Our intent is to keep only the customer data we need, for as short a time as we can, and be able to explain the choices. Start with a decision to delete raw conversations after 30 days and keep anonymised metrics for 2 years. Create the storage docs and link them to the decision. Propose the first design for my approval.

5. **Review and approve it yourself.**

   ```sh
   rdy pending
   ```

   This shows what waits for you, with the impact of each proposal. Approve with `rdy approve P-<id>`, or tell your agent your answer. When a proposal adds a decision, its option reads "Approve P-\<id\> and confirm D-\<id\>": approving it also confirms the decision.

6. **Read the result.**

   ```sh
   rdy site
   ```

   Open the link. The home page links to each page, and each page's address ends in `.html`. Now ask your agent: “For EU customers, raw conversations must be deleted after 7 days. Keep the 30-day rule elsewhere and the 2-year metrics window.” The agent briefs on the decision and its connected docs, follows the consequences, and brings you the proposal to approve.

   If `rdy pending` shows more than one card, answer each one. A change to a decision can add a card that asks you to confirm it. Until you answer it, `rdy approve` refuses with `E_EXCEPTION_OPEN` and names the card. Answer it with `rdy answer <ref> confirm`, where `<ref>` is the card's ref in `rdy pending`, such as `D-<id>@<hash>`. Then run `rdy approve P-<id>` again. Or tell your agent your answer.

   New content shows a **Planned** label. A new decision starts planned, so the content that cites it does too. Set `built` on the decision when the work ships.

   On a remote machine, the link is on `127.0.0.1`. Open an SSH tunnel to its port first, for example `ssh -L <port>:127.0.0.1:<port> <host>`.

   The site keeps running after `rdy site` exits. To stop it, run `rdy serve --stop` in the project folder. Your meta project has its own daemon: stop it with `rdy serve --stop --project ~/.rdy/meta`.

## What changed since 0.47.0

### New features

- **Repo links.** A project can cite the decisions and instructions that another project delivers. Name the other project in a repo link: `rdy new repo-link <alias> --parent <doc> --repo <id> --profile <id>`, or `rdy_write` in chat. The deliveries come from rdyhub, through rdy-adapter. rdy alone has no command that delivers content from one project to another.
  - Cite a delivered block as `<alias>:<id>`. Read it with `rdy show <alias>:<id>`, or `rdy_read` in chat. Cited content is read-only here: a write that changes it is refused with `E_FOREIGN_READ_ONLY`. A write that cites a version that no delivery holds is refused with `E_FOREIGN_VERSION`.
  - A citation pins the version it cites, and a new delivery moves no pin. When a delivery changes a block that you cite, `rdy pending` shows an adopt card: adopt the new version, or keep yours with a reason.
  - To depart from a cited decision or instruction, propose a decision with `deviates_from`. A person confirms it. Briefings then show the cited rule with your reason.
  - `rdy links`, `rdy links show <alias>` and `rdy links refs [<alias>]` show each link's state, what it delivers, and which pins are behind. In chat: `rdy_links`.
  - Briefings get a `links` part for cited content. Suspects and tensions also follow cited blocks.
  - `rdy adopt-upstream <old> <alias>:<id>` supersedes a local decision with the copy that its home project delivered back. In chat: `rdy_supersede` with `adopted_as`.
  - Organization and team instruction sets that a link delivers join your agents' rules. A deviation from a locked instruction of such a set is refused with `E_INSTRUCTION_LOCKED`.

### Changes

- **Breaking for older rdy: rdy 0.48.0 adds the store feature `foreign_copy` (class incompatible, minimum rdy 0.48.0); store format 19 and dump format 4 stay.** A store starts to use `foreign_copy` only when its project first writes a repo link (in any view, even before a delivery), and only a store or dump that uses it needs rdy 0.48.0: rdy 0.47.0 refuses one with `E_STORE_FORMAT` and names rdy 0.48.0. rdy 0.48.0 opens a store made by rdy 0.47.0 as it is, and loads every earlier dump.
- **Breaking for older rdy: rdy 0.48.0 adds sync stream format 3 (purpose `link_delivery`); a tag history stays sync stream format 2.** rdy 0.48.0 reads sync stream formats 2 and 3. rdy 0.47.0 reads sync stream format 2 only and refuses a format 3 file.
- **View names that start with `adopt-` are reserved** for adopt cards. Such a name is refused with `E_RESERVED_VIEW`, which is now in the `rdy_schema` error table.

### Fixes

- **Signing in to rdyhub works again.** rdy 0.48.0 signs in to rdyhub again, and keeps working when rdyhub adds fields to its replies.
- **Site landmarks and diagram captions.** The site's sidebar has the accessible name "Site". A diagram's caption now comes after the diagram's details, on the site and in prints, PDFs, copy as Markdown and `llms-full.txt`.

### Project and build

- **A shorter README.** It gives the install, a first project and links to the docs on getrdy.dev. The reference sections moved to the docs.
- **A sample project in the release.** `tally.rdydump` is a frozen sample project, Tally, made with rdy 0.47.0. `SHA256SUMS` lists it after the three archives. Load it with `rdy load tally.rdydump <directory>`.
- **rdy-adapter** gives the delivery exchange and the reads for repo links, for tools that build on it, such as rdyhub.

## Feedback

This is early. Tell us what worked and what did not: https://github.com/adrenickchrome/rdy-core/issues

**Known issues in this release:**

- A dispute, or a dispute resolution, made after a removal request still makes the request stale. Make the removal request again.
- A ruleset's "when" text can show two paragraphs when the first block of the ruleset holds two.
- When the project and your meta project each hold close to 5,000 rulesets, the menu can pass its 5,000-entry limit.
- When rdy cannot read the folder of your meta project, it treats the meta project as missing. Your own rules are then left out with no error.
- A validation error from your meta project loses its list of issues.
- `rdy setup` can overwrite a change that another tool saves to `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` while it runs. Run it when no other tool is saving those files.
- A malformed `load` value is refused with a different message from the documented one.
- `instructions.person` set outside the user config warns only on the CLI's standard error, not in the tool reply or the CLI's JSON.
- The CLI's plain-text briefing shows neither the as-built status nor `W_AS_BUILT_OVERRIDE`. `rdy show` and the MCP tools show both.
- A review page does not show the Planned or since label on removed content.
- A confirm can silence `W_AS_BUILT_OVERRIDE` even when another as-built item of the same proposal was updated, not confirmed.
- When a decision's `built` changes and then changes back, an earlier confirm silences `W_AS_BUILT_OVERRIDE` again.
- `rdy publication check --against` can miss what a shown section reveals when a planned decision outside the selection becomes built.
- In a project with very many keys in one doc, a key change can land without a new assessment.
- A rule that you remove twice and then state a third time, with the same text, selectors, ruleset and reason, stops as not ready. Give it a different reason.
- The tool schemas show example ids, such as `D-W2HXR`, `FW-E3` and `M2c3`, that look like real ids. They are only examples. Earlier releases showed them too.
- On Windows, the checksum step of the install guide, `Get-FileHash`, fails with "not recognized" when another program starts Windows PowerShell 5.1 from PowerShell 7. Run the step in a normal PowerShell 5.1 or 7 window.
- Your meta project has its own daemon. `rdy serve --stop` in a project does not stop it.
- A misspelt or unknown kind under a pack's `tensions_across` is ignored with no warning. The docs say it warns with `W_CONFIG_UNKNOWN`.
- Repo links. All but the first of these need deliveries from rdyhub:
  - Two views that each add a repo link with the same alias, for different repos, can both land. Reads then use the link with the lower block id.
  - A misspelt link kind on a cited target, such as `decided_byy`, is accepted with no warning.
  - A new project refuses a whole delivery with `E_UNRESOLVED_REF` when the delivery holds a version that was already redacted.
  - When two links deliver the same version, a removal proof taken through one link also erases the other link's copy. `rdy fsck` then fails for the other link.
  - After a link is revoked, the instructions that the project adopted through it are left out of `rdy_instructions`.
  - With two links to one project, adopting a new version of its instructions through one link also moves the other link's baseline.
  - An adopted instruction set takes its ruleset doc and its `required` flag from the latest delivery, but its rule text from the adopted version.
  - After a link is changed to another repo, a delivery equal to the last one is taken as unchanged, and still names the old repo.

Each archive's `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` gives the license of every library in the binary.

<details>
<summary><b>About Release 1</b></summary>

Release 1 (rdy 0.47.0) is the first release of rdy with a compatibility promise.
rdy stays below 1.0 during the beta, and the promise holds anyway.

From this release on, a change that breaks a contract surface ships with its upgrade path, in the same release. The contract surfaces are:

- the store, dump, sync batch and working-copy formats, and signatures;
- the CLI's commands, arguments, flags, exit codes and `--json` output;
- the MCP tools: their names, parameters and result fields;
- the `E_*` and `W_*` codes;
- the config keys and the pack format;
- the Markdown export layouts and the site's URLs.

A renamed name keeps working, with a warning, for two minor releases and at least 30 days, whichever ends later.
Text for people, such as messages, fix texts and help, can change in any release. Match a code, never its text.
Content that the docs mark as planned is outside the promise.

Every later rdy reads every dump that this rdy writes.
If this rdy refuses the store of a project from a preview with `E_STORE_FORMAT`, move the project with dump and load.
Run `rdy dump --out <file>` with the old rdy. Then run `rdy load <file> <dir>` with this rdy, into a directory with no store.
